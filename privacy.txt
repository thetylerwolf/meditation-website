WOLFLUX LLC
Privacy Policy
Effective 12 December 2017

In this Privacy Policy, "we," "us," "its" and "our" refer to WOLFLUX LLC and its affiliates ("Natural Meditation"), and "you" and "your" refer to you.
Before using the application and/or website(s) containing the link to this policy (the "App"), please read carefully this Privacy Policy ("Policy") relating to your use of the App and the Natural Meditation services ("Services").

A.  Introduction
This Policy tells you how we use and protect personally identifiable information collected through use of the App and Services.  This Policy covers only information that is collected through this App and Services.  This Policy does not cover other web sites that may be linked to or from this App or Services, and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from this App or Services; nor does this Policy apply to practices of companies that we do not control or to people we do not employ or manage.
By accepting the Policy during registration, you expressly consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Policy and to all other terms herein.  It may be possible for you to browse the App without telling us who you are or revealing any personally identifiable information about you. However, you lose anonymity once you give us your personal information, and by doing so, you agree to the transfer and storage of that information to our servers and to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

B.  Information Collected
The following personal identity information ("PII") about you may be collected and stored by us:
(i) name, email address and geo-location;
(ii) purchase information based on your activities on the App or Services;
(iii) ordering, billing and other similar information you provide to purchase an item or service;
(iv) activity and usage information based on your activities on the App or Services, such as statistics on your practice, etc.;
(v) dispute resolution, correspondence through the App and Services, and correspondence sent to us;
(vi) computer sign-on data, statistics on page views and traffic to and from the App or Services;
(vii) other technical information or data collected from App or Services traffic, including IP address and standard web log information;
(viii) supplemental or additional information we may request from you in the event previous information you've provided cannot be verified; and
(ix)  information that you voluntarily provide to us.
We collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use our Services, like a device identifier, user settings and the operating system of your device, as well as information about your use of our Services.
When you use the App, we may collect and store information about your location by converting your IP address into a rough geo-location or by accessing your mobile deviceâ€™s GPS coordinates or coarse location if you enable location services on your device.  We may use location information to improve and personalize our Services for you. If you do not want us to collect location information, you may disable that feature on your mobile device.

C.  Our Use of Information
We may combine your information with information we collect from other sources to improve the App.  We do not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your prior consent.
You agree that we may use your personal information as specified in the Terms of Service, and to:
(i) fulfil the purposes disclosed when you provided your information to us;
(ii) provide, deliver, and collect payment for the services, products, and customer support you request;
(iii) review and process applications for employment;
(iv) resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;
(v) prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our App- and Service-related agreements;
(vi) customize, measure, and improve our services and the App's content and layout;
(vii) tell you about targeted marketing and service updates based on your communication preferences; and
(viii) compare information for accuracy, and verify it with third parties.  Further, we may disclose personal information to respond to legal requirements, enforce Terms of Service or App policies, in connection with a merger, sale of assets, or other similar corporate transactions, respond to claims that a listing or other content violates the rights of others, or protect the rights, property, or safety or any person.
Our website may utilize "cookies", which are small files placed on your hard drive or computing device, to help analyze our web page flow, customize our services, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety.  Certain features are only available through the use of cookies, and generally we need to use cookies to help identify you and maintain your signed-in status. You are always free to decline website or Service cookies via your browser settings, although doing so may interfere with your use of the website or Services.  You may encounter cookies from third parties that we do not control.  In addition, the App or Services may incorporate pixel tags, web beacons or other web site usage measurement technologies.  Such devices are used to collect non-personally identifiable information, such as the identity of the applicable internet service provider, the user's IP address of his or her personal computer, the type of browser software and operating system in use, the date and time of site access, the website address, if any, from which the user linked, and other similar traffic-related information. Such information is used for the purposes described above. We may also aggregate such information with similar data collected from other users or disclose such information to third parties. However, we do not use such data in any way to create or maintain personally identifiable information from you.

D.  Sharing Information
We may also share your personal information with:
(i) members of our corporate family to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and provide joint services to requesting users;
(ii) service providers, consultants or similar contractors to support or enhance the App or our business operations, or to whom we contract in order to carry out transactions initiated by you, such as credit card processing organizations;
(iii) other third parties to whom you explicitly ask us to send your information (or about whom you are otherwise explicitly notified and solicited consent when using a specific service);
(iv) law enforcement or other governmental officials, in response to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity;
(v) persons we believe in our sole discretion necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity; and
(vi) other business entities, should we plan to merge with, or be acquired by that business entity.
We may periodically send you free newsletters and e-mails that directly promote our Services. When you receive such promotional communications from us, you will have the opportunity to "opt-out" (either through your Account or by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive). We do need to send you certain communications regarding the Services, such as communications regarding updates to our Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy, and you will not be able to opt out of those communications.

E.  Security
We take reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.  No method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure and accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.

F. Applicability
Except as otherwise expressly included in this Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether they are users on the App or other Apps throughout the Internet, different rules may apply.

G.  Children
The App and Services are not directed to children under thirteen (13) years of age, and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from such children. If you are younger than thirteen, please do not provide any personally identifiable information to us.  If a person 13 years of age or younger has provided personal information to us, a parent or guardian of such person should contact us at help@naturalmeditationapp.com so that we can remove such personal information from our database.

J.  Jurisdiction
WOLFLUX LLC is located in the United States, as are the servers that make the App available.  All matters relating to privacy issues are governed by the laws of the United States.

K.  Policy Changes
We may amend this Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on the App, which will automatically take effect after they are initially posted except as otherwise specified.

L.  Inquiries or Complaints
